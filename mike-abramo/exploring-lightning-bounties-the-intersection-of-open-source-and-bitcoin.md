# Exploring Lightning Bounties: The Intersection of Open-Source and Bitcoin

## The State of Open Source Development

In the $1.5 trillion software industry, open-source software has become the foundation of innovation, with 90% of companies relying on it. However, a striking disparity exists: while 76% of modern codebases are built on open-source foundations, only 21% of maintainers receive compensation for their invaluable contributions. This misalignment is particularly glaring, considering [GitHub's massive ecosystem of over 100 million developers contributing more than 5.2 billion commits annually.](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/)

The challenge lies not in a lack of talent but in infrastructure and incentives. Millions of skilled developers, especially in the Global South, remain disconnected from high-impact opportunities due to traditional banking restrictions, complex payment systems, and geographical barriers. This untapped potential hinders innovation and stifles the growth of critical projects.
