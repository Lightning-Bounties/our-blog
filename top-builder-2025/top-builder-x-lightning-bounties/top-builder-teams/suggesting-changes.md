## Understanding GitBook's integration with GitHub <a href="#understanding-gitbooks-integration-with-github" id="understanding-gitbooks-integration-with-github"></a>

We use a platform called [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) to host, manage and serve our documentation. GitBook fetches files from our GitHub repository [**Lightning-Bounties/our-blog**](https://github.com/Lightning-Bounties/our-blog/issues/4), reads them and converts them into the pages you can access on [docs.lightningbounties.com](https://docs.lightningbounties.com). A generic structure of a documentation hosted on GitBook would look like this:\


{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Generic Structure of a  GitBook" %}
```markup
First page
â”œâ”€â”€ A group of pages

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ A page
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Another page
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ One more page
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ A nested page
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Another nested page
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Its mirror to GitHub, on the other hand, would have the following structure:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Basic Structure of a GitBook Mirror Repo" %}
```markup
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitbook/
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ assets/
â”‚    â”‚    â””â”€â”€ an-image.png
â”œâ”€â”€ a-group-of-pages/
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ a-page.md
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ another-page.md
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ one-more-page/
â”‚    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ a-nested-page.md
â”‚    â”‚    â””â”€â”€ another-nested-page.md
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ SUMMARY.md
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* The `.gitbook/asset`s folder manages every file used in any page.&#x20;
* The `SUMMARY.md` file tells GitBook in which order we wish to display our pages and what groups there are in our documentation.
* The `README.md` file in the main folder has the contents of the first page users see when accessing the documentation website.
* Groups of pages are controlled by folders named after the group title (i.e. `a-group-of-pages`).
* Nested pages have a similar structure to groups of pages; however, a `README.md` file with the contents of the parent page must be added to the folder named after the parent page title.

### Editing Existing Pages <a href="#editing-existing-pages" id="editing-existing-pages"></a>

**1.** Open the page you want to edit. What you see next depends on the resolution of your screen and whether you are viewing that page zoomed in or not.

_**a.** On certain occasions, you may see a button saying **Edit on GitHub** above the **Table of Contents** on the right side of the page._

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/editOnGitHub.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Screenshot of our blog home page. A GitHub icon along with the text "Edit on GitHub" is seen above the Table of Contents.</p></figcaption></figure>

**2.** Click on the GitHub icon. This will direct you to the Markdown file in which the contents of the page are stored.

**3.** Click on the pencil icon (labeled "Edit this file"). This will open a basic editing environment in which you are able to customize aspects like line wrap and indentation.

**4.** Make any edits you need, remembering to always format them using Markdown. To understand better GitBook's implementation of Markdown, check [their reference guide](https://docs.gitbook.com/content-editing/markdown)

**5.** When you are done making changes, scroll down and write a short description of your changes. Select the option **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** and click on **Propose file change**. This will direct you to the **Pull request** page.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (41).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Screenshot of the Commit changes box. There are boxes for a brief description of the changes, an extended one, a selection menu for email addresses to associate with the commit, options to commit directly to the current branch or to create a new branch and a pull request (which opens an option to name your branch as you like) and buttons to either Propose file change or Cancel.</p></figcaption></figure>

**6.** On the **Pull request** page, write a short comment explaining why are proposing those changes (e.g. improving readability, covering cases that weren't mentioned, adding critical details about our platform) and publish your pull request clicking on **Create pull request**.\


<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image.avif" alt=""><figcaption><p>Screenshot of the Pull request page. It shows a box for the title of the Pull request, another for any comments. Below them, there's a Create pull request button.</p></figcaption></figure>
