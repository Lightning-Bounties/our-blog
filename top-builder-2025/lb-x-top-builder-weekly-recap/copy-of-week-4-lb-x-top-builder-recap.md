# Copy of Week 4: LB x Top Builder Recap

## PlebLab's Week 4 Recap: Lightning Bounties



### This Week's Journey: A Snapshot







## Bitcoin Marketing & Media with Brandon Keys

Brandon Keys delivered some hard-hitting truths that changed our perspective on marketing in the Bitcoin space. The biggest wake-up call? The best products don't always win—it's the ones that are effectively marketed and sold that succeed. As we build Lightning Bounties, this hit home: creating an amazing platform is crucial, but getting our message out there is equally important. Brandon encouraged us to start marketing now, not wait for some mythical "perfect moment," and to keep our branding consistent even if we're still refining our approach.&#x20;

His practical content creation tips were game-changing, especially around the power of presentation. When Brandon shared how he achieved 55x more views just by improving a thumbnail, it really drove home the importance of these seemingly small details. For our team, this means rethinking how we showcase our demos, educational content, and technical updates. What really resonated was his emphasis on personal branding within the Bitcoin ecosystem—showing the human side of our platform and sharing our building journey openly. It's exactly what we need as we continue building in public and engaging with fellow developers.&#x20;

### Must Watch: Shopstr on Early Days Podcast!&#x20;

Our journey with Shopstr began when we met CalDev at the 2024 PlebLab Startup Day in Mexico City, where his passion for revolutionizing e-commerce immediately resonated with our team. After watching their compelling Early Days podcast interview, we were inspired to try the platform ourselves. We purchased a Shopstr-themed t-shirt, and the experience perfectly demonstrated their vision - a seamless, peer-to-peer marketplace that just works. Unlike traditional platforms like eBay that take a hefty 15% cut from sellers, Shopstr's Bitcoin-native approach using Lightning Network for payments and Nostr for communication creates a more efficient, cost-effective solution for everyone involved.

What makes Shopstr truly revolutionary is how it solves fundamental problems in e-commerce. In their Early Days interview, CalDev shares how Shopstr emerged from the need to create a truly permissionless marketplace - one without the restrictive policies, high fees, and centralized control that plague Web2 platforms. Their mission extends beyond just creating another shopping site; it's about building a future where commerce is peer-to-peer, borderless, and accessible to everyone. The team's approach to bridging the gap to mainstream users is particularly impressive - making Bitcoin commerce as simple as traditional online shopping while maintaining the core benefits of decentralization.For aspiring builders in the Bitcoin space, Shopstr's journey offers valuable insights about focusing on user experience without compromising on decentralization principles. Want to experience the future of e-commerce yourself?&#x20;

## Lightning Bounties: Milestones & Achievements





### Initial Steps Toward Mentoring in the 2025 MIT Bitcoin Expo Hackathon

Our journey with the MIT Bitcoin Expo holds a special place in Lightning Bounties' story. After first meeting at the 2023 expo and then winning first place at the 2024 MIT Bitcoin Hackathon, we're thrilled to announce our return in 2025 - this time as mentors. Our transformation from hackathon participants to mentors represents a full-circle moment that embodies the collaborative spirit of the Bitcoin community. In just one year, we've grown from a hackathon project into a platform that's been featured in Bitcoin News and presented at events like the 2024 PlebLab Startup Day. Recent discussions with the MIT Bitcoin Expo organizers have opened exciting opportunities for Lightning Bounties to give back to the community that helped launch us. We'll be sharing our experience and knowledge with the next generation of Bitcoin builders, helping teams develop their ideas and navigate the challenges we faced just a year ago. Our focus will be on supporting projects that align with freedom tech principles and fostering the kind of innovation that can shape Bitcoin's future. The 2025 MIT Bitcoin Expo is happening on April 5th-6th, and we encourage everyone in the Bitcoin community to get involved! Whether you're interested in being a speaker, sponsor, attendee, or hackathon participant, there are numerous ways to contribute to this incredible event. The expo represents a unique opportunity to connect with builders, learn from industry leaders, and potentially launch your own Bitcoin journey - just like we did.  Visit [https://mitbtcexpo.org/index.html](https://mitbtcexpo.org/index.html) to learn more about participation opportunities and join us in shaping the future of Bitcoin!
