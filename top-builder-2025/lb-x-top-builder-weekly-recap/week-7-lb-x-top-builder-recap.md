## Bitcoin Startup Accounting&#x20;

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/UtSgI1wYkoY?si=2Zkt-CnMozyUSrm-" %}

_Workshop Recap with Joe Wood (Satoshi Patoli)_

Bitcoin businesses face a minefield of accounting quirks—but Joe Wood’s workshop cut through the noise. Here’s what builders need to know:

### **1. Accounting for Bitcoin: What Actually Matters**

* **Valuation**: Bitcoin’s price swings hit your balance sheet. Unrealized gains/losses now get tracked, so monitor them like hawk.
* **Taxes**: Holding Bitcoin? No taxes until you sell/spend it. But _every transaction_ (sending, receiving, swapping) triggers a taxable event. Track sats like your freedom depends on it—because it does.

### **2. Using Bitcoin as Payment**

* **Price It in USD**: When accepting Bitcoin for goods/services, record the USD value _at receipt_. Volatility isn’t an excuse for lazy bookkeeping.
* **Employees Love Sats**: Paying team members in Bitcoin boosts morale (if you’re already holding). But warn them: selling = taxable income.

### **3. Holding Bitcoin: Treasury Strategy**

* **Risk Check**: How much volatility can your startup stomach? If investors panic at -30% dips, maybe don’t put 80% of cash reserves in Bitcoin.
* **Investor Optics**: Fundraising? Assume VCs will grill your Bitcoin treasury strategy. Prepare answers tighter than a 21M supply cap.

### **4. International Payments: Bitcoin’s Killer App**

* **Speed Wins**: Pay global contractors in minutes, not days. Traditional banks can’t compete.
* **Tools Matter**: Use non-custodial processors like **Zap** to avoid third-party risk.

### **5. Accounting Tools for Bitcoiners**

* **Zap**: Track payments without handing keys to a custodian.
* **Clan Tech**: Open-source accounting suite for Bitcoin-only businesses.
* **Banking**: Mercury/Brex still work, but keep Bitcoin transactions separate.

### **Biggest Pitfalls**

* **Tax Surprises**: That Lightning payment you sent? Taxable. That refund you received? Taxable. Assume everything’s taxable until proven otherwise.
* **Custody Risks**: Mixing custodial/non-custodial wallets? Recipe for audit hell. Segregate funds like a cypherpunk monk.

**Why This Matters for Builders**\
Bitcoin accounting isn’t about compliance—it’s about survival. Messy books attract regulators. Sloppy tax reporting kills startups. Joe’s takeaway? _“Run your Bitcoin business like a Fortune 500 company, but with better money.”_
