# Week 3: LB x Top Builder Recap

## PlebLab's Week 3 Recap: Lightning Bounties



Documenting our journey through PlebLab's Top Builder competition is more than just a weekly update—it's an inside look at the invaluable resources and mentorship shaping the future of Bitcoin innovation. Week 3 was particularly intense, packed with workshops that delivered crucial insights for early-stage startups like Lightning Bounties.This week, we had the privilege of attending four transformative sessions:

Documenting our journey in PlebLab's Top Builder competition goes beyond weekly updates—it's an in-depth exploration of the invaluable resources and mentorship shaping the future of Bitcoin innovation. Week 3 was particularly demanding, filled with workshops offering vital insights for early-stage startups like Lightning Bounties. This week, we had the privilege of attending

Each workshop was so rich with actionable advice that we've decided to focus on highlighting key takeaways rather than diving deep into each one. To do justice to these presentations would require a much longer read, but we encourage fellow builders to seek out these mentors directly.



## Mentor Session - Phil of [21M Communications](https://www.21mcommunications.com/)

This session sharpened our approach to media strategy as a Bitcoin startup, emphasizing how to protect our mission from misrepresentation. We learned to anchor messaging in clear problem-solution narratives—for Lightning Bounties, this means spotlighting how instant Bitcoin payouts break barriers for developers globally. Phil stressed targeting Bitcoin-native outlets like [_**Bitcoin News**_](https://bitcoinnews.com/) while cautioning against legacy media’s tendency to twist narratives, as seen in the [Boston Globe’s misleading framing of Caroline Ellison’s fraud as a “crypto issue”](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/12/06/business/caroline-ellison-math-whiz-newton-native-was-bound-success-then-she-got-into-crypto/) rather than individual misconduct.

Key insights included tailoring pitches for B2B (project owners) versus B2C (developers), leveraging partnerships for credibility, and collaborating with Bitcoin communities in regions like Africa to address local payment challenges. To counter legacy media’s fixation on price speculation, we’ll pivot interviews to our core mission: fair, borderless compensation for developers. These strategies will ensure our story stays focused during Top Builder, amplifying our impact while safeguarding Bitcoin’s transformative potential.

## AMA Session with Topher Scott&#x20;

This week’s AMA with Topher Scott underscored a critical insight: Lightning’s growth depends on lowering barriers, not just moving money. At Lightning Bounties, we’re leveraging our _Lightning Instance_—a self-hosted node that enables developers to earn Bitcoin without needing external wallets. This approach directly addresses the friction many new users face, especially those transitioning from Web2. Hearing Super Testnet’s emphasis on comprehensive documentation resonated deeply, as we’re currently building detailed guides through our documentation, crafting short form YouTube tutorials for using our platform, and planning future workshops to educate users. For developers unfamiliar with Lightning, these resources will demystify everything from claiming bounties to withdrawing sats, ensuring no one gets left behind.

This session reminded us that Lightning is still in its infancy, with vast opportunities for innovation. Collaboration, not competition, drives progress. We’re actively partnering with Top Builder teams and engaging the PlebLab community to refine our platform.&#x20;

## Product, Users, and Revenue with Santos Hernandez

Santos' mentorship session discussed the importance of _user-centric design_ and _strategic monetization_ for Bitcoin startups. A key takeaway was the need to prioritize honest user feedback through anonymous surveys, asking questions like _“What frustrates you about our platform?”_ to uncover pain points. For Lightning Bounties, this means incentivizing developers with sats for candid feedback, ensuring we address barriers for global contributors. Santos stressed that ignoring competitors is a red flag—rigorous SWOT analysis helps identify gaps in the market. For example, studying how competitors handle onboarding or fees allows us to refine our own approach, focusing on what Michael Porter calls _“choosing what not to do.”_

The session also highlighted the critical role of _frictionless user journeys_. Tracking every step from signup to logout reveals where users drop off, enabling iterative improvements. While Santos emphasized tutorial videos, we’re doubling down on written guides and in-app tooltips to simplify onboarding for developers new to Lightning. Building in public remains vital: sharing progress on Bitcoin-native platforms like Nostr and [Stacker News](https://stacker.news/) fosters community trust and attracts early adopters. As Reid Hoffman noted, _“If you’re not embarrassed by v1, you launched too late._

**Monetization & Growth: Lessons for Lightning Startups**\
Santos challenged the myth of delaying revenue, urging startups to monetize early. For Lightning Bounties, this means testing a small fee-per-bounty model while focusing on retention through gamification (e.g., achievement badges for top contributors). Email marketing, often overlooked in Bitcoin, offers a 36:1 ROI—a tool we’ll leverage for product updates and educational content. Retention tactics like rewarding loyal users and reactivating inactive ones are 5-25x cheaper than acquisition.&#x20;

Collaboration within the Top Builder ecosystem, such as cross-promotions with other teams, amplifies growth organically.Ultimately, the workshop reinforced that Bitcoin startups thrive by balancing user needs with sustainable revenue. For Lightning Bounties, this means staying lean, iterating quickly, and keeping the _“build in public”_ ethos at our core—turning every piece of feedback into a step toward reshaping open-source collaboration.

## Investing in Bitcoin Companies with Dr. Arman Meguerian

[Dr. Arman Meguerian’s](https://x.com/DrBitcoinMD) workshop offered a sobering yet strategic look at fundraising for Bitcoin startups, emphasizing that raising capital is “brutal but sometimes necessary.” For Lightning Bounties, his insights arrived at a pivotal moment as we transition from an LLC to a C-corp—a move critical for attracting investors. Arman stressed the importance of getting corporate structure right early, from equity allocation to bylaws, to avoid costly revisions later. His guidance, coupled with our monthly consultations, has been invaluable in navigating this complex process while maintaining focus on product growth.

A key takeaway was the need to “speak the language of fundraising,” particularly when pitching to investors. Arman’s framework for pitch decks—starting with problem-solution narratives and bottom-up market sizing—reshaped how we articulate Lightning Bounties’ value. Instead of claiming “1% of the global developer market,” we now calculate our Total Addressable Market (TAM) based on active  [Bitcoin contributors](https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report), making projections more credible. For early-stage startups like ours, he advised prioritizing proof-of-work milestones (e.g., user traction, partnerships) to build investor confidence without over-diluting equity.

[**Timestamp Financial: Invest In Bitcoin Startups with as Little as $100**](https://www.timestampfinancial.com/)

As co-founder of [Timestamp Financia](https://www.timestampfinancial.com/)[l,](https://www.timestampfinancial.com/) Arman practices what he preaches. The platform disrupts traditional venture capital by letting _anyone_ invest in early-stage Bitcoin startups with as little as **$100**—no accreditation required. Current listings include [**Jippi**](https://jippi.app/), a Pokémon Go-style game rewarding players with Bitcoin, and [**Shopstr**](https://shopstr.store/), a Nostr-based marketplace slashing eBay’s 15% fees. These projects exemplify Bitcoin’s potential to reimagine industries through decentralized applications.

For Lightning Bounties, Timestamp represents more than funding—it’s a community-powered launchpad. While we’re early in our C-corp transition, the platform’s ethos mirrors our vision of open collaboration. Future listings will invite supporters to back our mission directly, turning users into stakeholders. As we refine our pitch and structure, Timestamp’s model—like Arman’s mantra of “no half-measures”—reminds us that Bitcoin’s future is built by those willing to democratize access, one sat at a time.

## Wrapping it Up

These workshops have reshaped our approach to everything from user onboarding to fundraising strategy. As we apply these lessons, we're more committed than ever to building in public and iterating quickly based on user feedback.Next week, we'll shift focus to Lightning Bounties' recent developments, including:

* New bounty hunters joining our platform and bounties solved
* A comprehensive explainer on why GitHub login is necessary (we only request read-only access)
* Our exciting meeting with MIT BTC Expo, where we're exploring the possibility of mentoring hackers and enabling bounty postings for hackathon projects

We're also making progress on our transition from LLC to C-corp, guided by insights from Dr. Meguerian's workshop and our ongoing consultations.&#x20;
