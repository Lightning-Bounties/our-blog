# Week 5: LB x Top Builder Recap



## PlebLab's Week 5 Recap: Lightning Bounties





## Three key mentor sessions/workshops:





### Austin Kelsay (PlebDevs & Voltage)

[Austin Kelsay](https://x.com/bitcoinplebdev), DevRel at [Voltage ](https://x.com/voltage_cloud)and Founder/Instructor at [PlebDevs](https://plebdevs.com/), shared his extensive expertise in a dynamic mentorship session focused on Lightning Network development and education. Through [PlebDevs.com](https://plebdevs.com/), [Austin ](https://x.com/bitcoinplebdev)has built a content and community platform that uniquely integrates Lightning Network and Nostr, demonstrating practical applications of the technologies he teaches. His enthusiasm for emerging technologies, particularly [Open Secret ](https://x.com/OpenSecretCloud)and [Nostr ](https://nostr.com/)developments, showcased the exciting possibilities for decentralized authentication and server administration in Bitcoin applications.&#x20;

The session dove into practical aspects of Lightning development, with Austin highlighting essential tools like Polar [(lightningpolar.com](https://lightningpolar.com/)) as the `'Hello World'` starting point for Lightning Network development. His recommendations for Lightning applications provided real-world examples of innovation in action - from [Zeus ](https://zeusln.com/)to Mutiny Network, and particularly [Nostr Wallet Connect](https://nwc.dev/) (NWC) for automated recurring Lightning subscriptions. For Lightning Bounties, Austin's insights about building on adversarial networks while maintaining user sovereignty align perfectly with our mission to create a trustless bug bounty platform.

What particularly resonated with our team was [Austin's ](https://x.com/bitcoinplebdev)perspective on how Nostr and Lightning Network complement each other, creating possibilities for authentication and payments that weren't previously possible. His experience both as DevRel at[ Voltage](https://www.voltage.cloud/) and building [PlebDevs.com](https://x.com/pleb_devs) offers valuable lessons as we continue developing Lightning Bounties' features and community engagement tools.





### Ted Thayer (FeedFilter AI)

Ted Thayer from FeedFilter.AI delivered an invaluable mentorship session focused on the critical aspects of building and pitching Bitcoin startups. Drawing from his experience with three early-stage startups, Ted emphasized the fundamental importance of thorough market research and understanding user problems. His current venture, FeedFilter.AI, which helps users filter out unwanted content from social media feeds, served as a practical example of identifying and solving real user pain points. For our team at Lightning Bounties, his insights about conducting market research early and often resonated deeply with our mission to make bug bounty hunting more accessible and rewarding.&#x20;

The session transformed how we view Lightning Bounties' market potential and pitch strategy. Ted's advice to "build your startup deck, then delete 90% of your words" helped us refine our core message: anyone with a GitHub account can earn Bitcoin instantly through open-source contributions. His warning about Bitcoin founders underselling their total addressable market (TAM) hit home - our platform's reach extends to every developer and organization using GitHub worldwide.

### Bitcoin UX For the Streets by Stephen Delorme

Stephen DeLorme delivered an eye-opening workshop on Bitcoin UI/UX design that demonstrated the power of combining AI tools with traditional design principles. The interactive session showcased how tools like Midjourney can revolutionize the design process - what typically takes weeks of UI component development, Stephen accomplished in minutes through well-crafted AI prompts that combined specific requirements with style references.

For Lightning Bounties, learning that ShadCN works seamlessly with AI coding tools like Cursor was a game-changer. As our preferred component library, we initially had concerns about AI compatibility with newer design frameworks like ShadCN. Stephen's demonstrations eliminated these doubts, providing us with a clear pathway to enhance our live coding sessions. We're already implementing these insights as we test AI coding tools, using his workshop as a practical guide to sharpen our development process.The workshop's emphasis on UI/UX testing strategies, particularly gathering multiple perspectives while making users comfortable with statements like "We are testing the UI/UX, not you," perfectly aligns with our mission to create an intuitive platform. Want to see how AI tools can transform your design process?&#x20;

### Must Watch Branta on Early Days Podcast

Branta's appearance on Early Days podcast offered a compelling look into their mission to make Bitcoin transactions safer and more transparent. Founded by Keith, a former Bloomberg veteran, Branta's latest product "Guardrail" addresses a critical challenge in Bitcoin's path to mass adoption: verifying payment addresses and invoices before sending funds. This elegant solution helps ensure users never send payments to unintended destinations, addressing one of the most significant risks in Bitcoin transactions.

Keith's emphasis on solving real problems and his transition from traditional finance to Bitcoin entrepreneurship showcases the opportunities within the ecosystem. Want to learn more about how Branta is making Bitcoin transactions safer?
