#### **Introduction:**

When I first heard about [TABConf,](https://6.tabconf.com/) it was described as “_the most open-source Bitcoin conference out there._” Naturally, I was intrigued 🤔. A space where developers, innovators, and Bitcoin enthusiasts gather to share, build, and push the boundaries of what’s possible? Count me in 🙌.

This year, it was extra special because I wasn’t going solo—I had [Will ](https://www.lightningbounties.com/team)from the [Lightning Bounties](https://www.lightningbounties.com) team with me. Together, we represented our [startup ](https://www.lightningbounties.com/team)⚡️ and explored the vibrant ecosystem of Bitcoin builders. From October 23rd to 26th, we immersed ourselves in four exciting and occasionally overwhelming days at Georgia Tech in Atlanta 🍑.

Here’s how we made the most of it:

***

#### **Day 1: Setting the Stage and Building Connections 🌟**

Day 1 was all about first impressions and laying the groundwork 🎤. [Will ](https://www.lightningbounties.com/team)and I kicked off the day by meeting incredible innovators and soaking in the collaborative vibe 💻.

We had some amazing conversations, including with:

* [**DIY JADE** ](https://github.com/epiccurious/jade-diy)🛠️: This team is working on a DIY device based on ESP32 for Bitcoin wallets. Their commitment to open-source reminded us of why Lightning Bounties exists in the first place.

* [**BITAXE** ](https://github.com/skot/bitaxe)⛏️: Skot and his team are making Bitcoin mining more accessible with low-cost devices. It’s grassroots innovation like this that makes the ecosystem so exciting.

* [**Citrea**](https://github.com/chainwayxyz/citrea) 🌌: [Ekrem ](https://github.com/exeokan)is pioneering decentralized rollups using Bitcoin blockspace for dApps. Will and I found it fascinating how their challenges with GitHub issue descriptions paralleled the problems we’re solving with Lightning Bounties 💼.

[**Branta** ](https://www.branta.pro/)🦢: We connected with the Branta team, who are enhancing Bitcoin and Lightning security by providing guardrails for transactions. This meeting was particularly fruitful, leading to a partnership where Branta now bolsters the security of our Lightning transactions. Their focus on verifying Bitcoin addresses before transactions has been instrumental in safeguarding our users from phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Talking with these builders wasn’t just inspiring—it gave us a ton of ideas about how Lightning Bounties can help streamline workflows and support creators globally 🌎.

#### **Day 2: Learning and Growing Through Workshops**

**Highlights from sessions:**\
Day 2 was packed with hands-on learning ✋📖. The [‘Taproot Assets on Lightning Workshop’ (#82) ](https://github.com/TABConf/6.tabconf.com/issues/82)gave me a deeper understanding of unlocking new potential in Bitcoin’s scalability 📈💡.

**Favorite takeaways:**\
[The workshop on Building Decentralized Web Apps (#93) ](https://github.com/TABConf/6.tabconf.com/issues/93)stood out 🚀—it aligned perfectly with Lightning Bounties’ mission of empowering developers to innovate with ease 🔧 and be rewarded for their contributions 💰.

It was amazing to see how the lessons from these workshops directly reinforced the importance of seamless integration 🌐, something we prioritize in our platform 🛠️.

#### **Day 3: Exploring Real-World Impact**

**Memorable sessions:**\
Sessions like[ 'El Salvador: Real-World Adoption Pathways'](https://github.com/TABConf/6.tabconf.com/issues/134) 🌍📜 and '[Supercharging Transactions with Async Payjoin](https://github.com/TABConf/6.tabconf.com/issues/98)' ⚡️🚀 highlighted the transformative potential of Bitcoin.

These discussions reinforced the global impact of tools like ours 🌎—making open-source contributions and Bitcoin adoption more accessible, particularly in regions like El Salvador.

#### **Day 4: Closing Strong and Looking Ahead**

**The vibe of the final day:**\
Day 4 wrapped up with advanced discussions and thought-provoking panels 💭✨. [‘Lightning Is Fixed Now’ (#44)](https://github.com/TABConf/6.tabconf.com/issues/44) was a powerful reminder of the ongoing innovations in this space 🔧⚙️.&#x20;

Also, [supertestnet](https://github.com/supertestnet), had a great workshop: [Build Your Own Layer Two #35](https://github.com/TABConf/6.tabconf.com/issues/35). I was able to create my layer two 😎😎.

The energy on the last day ⚡️ solidified a recurring theme throughout TABConf—collaboration is key 🤝. It’s the foundation of the Lightning Bounties vision, and seeing it in action here was inspiring 🚀.
